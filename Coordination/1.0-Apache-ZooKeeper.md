Apache ZooKeeper™
=================


## Welcome to Apache ZooKeeper™
Apache ZooKeeper is an effort to develop and maintain an open-source server
which enables **highly reliable distributed coordination**.

Apache ZooKeeper致力于开发和维护开源的**实现高度可靠的分布式协调的服务器**。


## What is ZooKeeper?/什么是ZooKeeper？
ZooKeeper is a `centralized service` for **maintaining configuration information, naming,
providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services**.
All of these kinds of services are used in some form or another by **distributed applications**.
Each time they are implemented there is `a lot of work that goes into fixing the bugs and race conditions that are inevitable`.
Because of `the difficulty of implementing` these kinds of services, applications initially usually skimp on them,
which make them brittle in the presence of change and `difficult to manage`.
Even when done correctly, `different implementations of these services lead to management complexity` when the applications are deployed.

ZooKeeper是一种`集中式服务`，用于**维护配置信息，命名，提供分布式同步和提供组服务**(使用场景)。
所有这些类型的服务都以分布式应用的某种形式使用。
每次实施它们都需要`做很多工作来修复不可避免的错误和竞争条件`。
即使正确地完成，这些`服务的不同实现`也会在部署应用时`导致管理复杂性`。
