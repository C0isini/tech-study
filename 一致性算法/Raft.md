## [Raft - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raft_(computer_science))

**Raft** is `a consensus algorithm` designed as an alternative to **Paxos**.
It was meant to be `more understandable` than Paxos by means of separation of logic,
but it is also formally proven `safe` and offers some additional features.
`Raft offers a generic way to distribute a state machine across a cluster of computing systems,
ensuring that each node in the cluster agrees upon the same series of state transitions.`
